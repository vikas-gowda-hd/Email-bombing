# Email-bombing
The Ultimate Email Sender – Power in Your Hands
Because when you send an email, it should hit like a missile.

This isn’t just a script—it’s a weapon. Built for those who understand efficiency, control, and the raw power of automation, this tool takes email sending to the next level. Whether you’re testing, demonstrating, or just proving that manual work is for the weak, this script does the job—flawlessly.

⚡ Features That Make It Unstoppable:
🔥 Gmail SMTP Integration – No fluff, just straight-up performance.
🔐 Secure Credential Handling – .env protection, because leaking passwords is amateur behavior.
🎭 Stealth Mode UI – Minimal, clean, and loaded with command-line swagger.
💣 Bulk Email Sending – Because one hit isn’t enough.
🛡️ TLS Encryption & Fail-Safe Handling – No weak links, no compromises.
⚙️ How It Works (Step into the Arena)
Loads Up the Arsenal – Fetches email credentials from a secure .env file.
Authenticates Like a Ghost – Logs into Gmail SMTP with an App Password (because real pros don’t use direct login).
Locks & Loads – Assembles the email using MIME, sets sender, recipient, and subject.
Executes with Precision – Fires emails through Google’s SMTP Server (smtp.gmail.com, port 587).
Engages Auto-Mode – Sends multiple emails with controlled timing—because real power isn’t reckless.
🔑 Before You Deploy This Beast:
✅ Create a separate Gmail account – Never mix business with pleasure.
✅ Turn on Two-Step Verification – Weak security is for NPCs.
✅ Generate an App Password – Because alpha coders don’t get blocked by Gmail.

⚠️ WARNING: This script is a tool, not a toy. Use it wisely, stay ethical, and don’t be the guy who misuses power.

Clone it. Run it. Dominate. Welcome to the next level.
